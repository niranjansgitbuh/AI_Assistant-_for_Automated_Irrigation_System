# AI_Assistant-_for_Automated_Irrigation_System
AI assistant for automated irrigation that regulates water valves based on soil moisture in the crop root zone. It integrates with hardware to monitor moisture, control valves, and provides real-time alerts on moisture changes and water overflow, optimizing water usage in micro-irrigation systems.
# Project Overview
The agricultural sector often faces challenges in efficient water management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Traditional irrigation methods either over-irrigate or under-irrigate crops, leading to water wastage, reduced crop yield, or increased resource use. The lack of real-time data on soil moisture in the root zone and manual control of water release further complicates efficient irrigation practices.
To address this, an AI-powered assistant has been designed to regulate water release automatically. The assistant integrates with hardware sensors to monitor real-time soil moisture, process the data using AI algorithms, and adjust water flow accordingly. The system not only automates irrigation but also sends alerts about soil moisture levels and potential water overflow. This ensures precise water management, preventing water wastage, and increasing crop yield efficiency.
